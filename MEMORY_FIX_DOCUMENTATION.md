# Memory Issue Fix - Unified State Management

## Problem Description

The ticketwatch system was showing "unknown" as the previous price for URLs even after they had been scanned multiple times. This was happening because:

1. **State Fragmentation**: Each batch job (`batch1.txt`, `batch2.txt`, etc.) had its own separate state file (`batch1.txt.state.json`, etc.)
2. **Duplicate URLs**: Some URLs existed in multiple batch files, causing confusion
3. **Memory Loss**: When a batch job ran, it only loaded its own state file, losing historical data from other batches or the main state file

## Root Cause Analysis

- **Duplicate URL Found**: `https://www.ticketweb.ca/event/autoheart-the-heartlands-the-pearl-tickets/14388293` existed in both `batch1.txt` and `batch5.txt`
- **State Inconsistencies**: 350+ inconsistencies found across batch states vs main state
- **Isolated State Loading**: Each batch job only accessed its own state file, ignoring historical data from other sources

## Solution: Unified State Management

### Key Changes Made

1. **Unified State Loading** (`load_unified_state()`):
   - Loads data from `state.json` (main state)
   - Merges data from `unified_state.json` (consolidated historical data)
   - Merges data from all batch state files (`batch*.txt.state.json`)
   - Prioritizes complete data over incomplete entries

2. **Unified State Saving** (`save_unified_state()`):
   - Saves to batch-specific state file (for compatibility)
   - Updates the unified state file with all historical data
   - Ensures no historical data is lost

3. **Duplicate URL Removal**:
   - Removed duplicate URL from `batch5.txt`
   - System now has 359 unique URLs across 5 batches

4. **GitHub Actions Update**:
   - Workflow now commits `unified_state.json` along with batch state files
   - Ensures unified state is preserved across runs

### File Structure

```
├── state.json                    # Main state file (legacy)
├── unified_state.json            # New unified historical data
├── url_batches/
│   ├── batch1.txt                # URLs for batch 1
│   ├── batch1.txt.state.json     # State for batch 1
│   ├── batch2.txt                # URLs for batch 2
│   ├── batch2.txt.state.json     # State for batch 2
│   └── ... (etc)
```

### How It Works

1. **When a batch job starts**:
   - Loads unified state from ALL sources (379 total entries)
   - Ensures complete historical data is available
   - No more "unknown" previous prices

2. **When processing URLs**:
   - Compares current prices against unified historical data
   - Shows real price transitions: "$31.50 → $41.52" instead of "unknown → $41.52"

3. **When saving results**:
   - Updates batch-specific state file
   - Updates unified state with new data
   - Preserves all historical information

## Test Results

✅ **Before Fix**: "unknown → $41.52"  
✅ **After Fix**: "$31.50 → $41.52"

✅ **State Loading**: 379 URLs with historical data loaded successfully  
✅ **No Memory Loss**: All previous prices preserved  
✅ **Cross-Batch Compatibility**: All batch jobs now share complete historical data  

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates "Unknown" Previous Prices**: All price changes now show real previous values
2. **Preserves Historical Data**: No data loss when URLs move between batches or system changes
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing batch system continues to work
4. **Future-Proof**: New URLs automatically get added to unified state
5. **Robust**: System can recover from individual batch state file corruption

## Maintenance

The unified state system is self-maintaining:
- New data automatically merges into unified state
- GitHub Actions automatically commits updates
- No manual intervention required
- System gracefully handles missing or corrupted individual state files
