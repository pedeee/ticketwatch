# Recent Fixes Applied to Ticketwatch Repository

## Overview
This document summarizes the recent code improvements and bug fixes applied to your ticketwatch GitHub repository.

## âœ… Recent Fixes Applied

### 1. **Batch File Overwriting Issue (Fixed)**
**Problem:** Bot was overwriting batch files when it failed to fetch URLs, replacing dates with "Unknown Event - No date found"
**Solution:** Modified `save_sorted_urls()` to only run when bot successfully fetches data
**Files Modified:** `ticketwatch_v2.py`

### 2. **Bot Failure with Exit Code 128 (Fixed)**
**Problem:** Running 5 Python processes in parallel was causing resource conflicts
**Solution:** Changed to sequential batch processing with better error handling
**Files Modified:** `.github/workflows/ticketwatch-hourly.yml`

### 3. **Anti-Bot Protection Enhanced**
**Problem:** Ticketweb was blocking requests with 403 Forbidden errors
**Solution:** 
- Reduced MAX_CONCURRENT from 5 to 3
- Increased REQUEST_DELAY from 2.0s to 3.0s
- Increased cloudscraper delay from 5000ms to 8000ms
- Enhanced HTTP headers for GitHub Actions
**Files Modified:** `ticketwatch_v2.py`

### 4. **Batch System Implementation**
**Problem:** Bot was only processing 200 URLs instead of all available URLs
**Solution:** Implemented proper batch system processing all 281 URLs across 5 batches
**Files Modified:** `.github/workflows/ticketwatch-hourly.yml`, `ticketwatch_v2.py`

### 5. **File Cleanup**
**Removed:** Unnecessary files including old `ticketwatch.py`, `urls.txt`, `urls_example.txt`, `run_hourly.py`
**Cleaned:** Updated documentation and removed outdated references

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Status
- **Total URLs:** 281 across 5 batch files
- **Processing:** Sequential batch processing (more stable)
- **Anti-bot:** Enhanced protection for GitHub Actions
- **Error Handling:** Improved with specific failure messages
- **File Protection:** Batch files won't be corrupted on failure

## ðŸš€ Ready for Testing
The bot is now ready for testing with all major issues resolved.
