# Ticketwatch v2.0 - Setup Guide

## 🚀 What's New

Your improved ticketwatch now handles **400-500 URLs efficiently** with:

- **⚡ 20x faster**: Concurrent processing instead of sequential
- **🔔 Smart notifications**: Batched alerts, no spam
- **🛡️ Rate limiting**: Respectful to servers, avoids IP blocks  
- **📊 Progress tracking**: See real-time monitoring progress
- **🔄 Auto-retry**: Robust error handling with exponential backoff
- **✅ Health checks**: Single notification when nothing changes

## 📦 Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up Telegram bot** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   export TG_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"
   export TG_CHAT="your_chat_id_here"
   ```

3. **Create your URL list:**
   ```bash
   # Add your Ticketweb URLs to urls.txt (one per line)
   echo "https://example.ticketweb.com/event1" >> urls.txt
   echo "https://example.ticketweb.com/event2" >> urls.txt
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit these settings in `ticketwatch_v2.py`:

```python
MAX_CONCURRENT  = 20     # How many URLs to check simultaneously
REQUEST_DELAY   = 0.1    # Seconds between requests
BATCH_SIZE      = 10     # Changes per notification batch
RETRY_ATTEMPTS  = 3      # Retry failed requests

## 🔧 Performance

For **500 URLs**:
- **Old version**: ~25 minutes (sequential)
- **New version**: ~2-3 minutes (concurrent)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Too many requests" errors:**
- Increase `REQUEST_DELAY` to 0.2 or higher
- Reduce `MAX_CONCURRENT` to 10 or lower

**Memory issues:**
- Process URLs in smaller batches
- Consider splitting your URL list

**Telegram not working:**
- Check `TG_TOKEN` and `TG_CHAT` environment variables
- Verify bot permissions in your chat

## 📋 Migration from Old Version

1. **Backup your current setup:**
   ```bash
   cp ticketwatch.py ticketwatch_old.py
   cp urls.txt urls_backup.txt
   ```

2. **Use the new version:**
   ```bash
   python ticketwatch_v2.py
   ```

3. **Your existing `urls.txt` and `state.json` files work as-is!**
